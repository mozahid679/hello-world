# Teknivers

Welcome to GitHub—where millions of developers work together on software. Ready to get started? Let’s learn how this all works by building and publishing your first GitHub Pages website!

```
<p>Hello World! I’m [username]. This is my website!</p>
```

To add your introduction, copy our template and click the edit pencil icon at the top right hand corner of the `index.html` file.

Delete this placeholder line:

```
<p>Welcome to your first GitHub Pages website!</p>
```

Then, paste the template to line 15 and fill in the blanks.

When you’re done, scroll down to the `Commit changes` section near the bottom of the edit page. Add a short message explaining your change, like "Add my introduction", then click `Commit changes`.

Once you click `Commit changes`, your changes will automatically be published on your GitHub Pages website. Refresh the page to see your new changes live in action.

:tada: You just made your first commit! :tada:

## Work with GitHub on your computer using GitHub Desktop

**GitHub Desktop** is a free app from GitHub for Windows and Mac that allows you to easily work with your GitHub repositories from your computer. You just saw how you can commit to a repository from GitHub.com, but most developers do the majority of their work from their computer (locally) before pushing it up to GitHub. So let’s try that out!

[Download GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

## Practice: Use GitHub Desktop and an editor to make a change from your computer

Start by downloading GitHub Desktop if you haven’t already done so, and install it on your computer. Go through the GitHub Desktop onboarding steps, and when you get to the “Let’s get started” screen, go ahead and choose the repository you were just working with on GitHub.com, and click “Clone.”

### Commit your changes

Now you can commit your changes by typing a message in the `Summary` box at the bottom left, and then click the blue `Commit` button below that.

![Commit-changes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/721500/63188831-8262ff80-c030-11e9-809a-f87d8b544935.png)

### Celebrate!

Hooray! Now you have your repository linked between your computer and GitHub.com. In the future, you can use GitHub Desktop to push any changes you decide to make from your computer.

## Extra Credit: Keep on building!

Change the placeholder Octocat gif on your GitHub Pages website by [creating your own personal Octocat emoji](https://myoctocat.com/build-your-octocat/) or [choose a different Octocat gif from our logo library here](https://octodex.github.com/). Add that image to line 12 of your `index.html` file, in place of the `<img src=` link.

Want to add even more code and fun styles to your GitHub Pages website? [Follow these instructions](https://github.com/github/personal-website) to build a fully-fledged static website.

## Everything you need to know about GitHub

Getting started is the hardest part. If there’s anything you’d like to know as you get started with GitHub, try searching [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com). Our documentation has tutorials on everything from changing your repository settings to configuring GitHub from your command line.



# Teknivers
A template for README files that can be used for your future projects. A small description about the project, shields as well as the link to your repo.
Open and view the Project using the .zip file provided or at my GitHub Repository
The project is also hosted on GitHub Pages

## Getting Started
The project might have multiple branches: master, development, etc. which can be explained here
    • master contains aggregate code of all branches
    • development contains code under development
Other details that need to be given while starting out with the project can be provided in this section. A project structure like below can also be included for the big projects:
        project-title
        ├── README.md
        ├── package.json
        ├── .gitignore
        ├── public
        │   ├── favicon.ico
        │   ├── index.html
        │   └── manifest.json
        └── src
                ├── App.css
                ├── App.js
                ├── App.test.js
                ├── index.css

                ├── logo.svg
                └── serviceWorker.js
                └── setupTests.js
### Tools Required
All tools required go here. You would require the following tools to develop and run the project:
    •  A terminal like ( Windows terminal for Windows, Homebrew for Mac Os).
    •  A text editor or an IDE (like Visual Studio Code, or Sublime Text Editor).
    • Any relational database software (like Laragon). If you use Laragon then simply go www directory and then clone the repository there and simply run the project as teknivers.test in your browser. NB: To run .test you need to configure laragon as Nginx.
    •  A browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.
### Installation
You can install and use **Teknivers** as follows:
All installation steps go here.

1. Clone or download this Repositories (https://github.com/Eurosiamart-Rayple-IT-Development/Teknivers).
2. If the file was downloaded, then unzip it and open it on a Code Editor.
3. 


## Development
This section is completely optional. For big projects, the developement strategies are not discussed. But for small projects, you can give some insight to people. It has 2 benefits in my opinion:
    1. It's a way to give back to the community. People get to learn from you and appreciate your work
    2. You can refer the README in future as a quick refresher before an interview or for an old project to check if it can help you in your currect work
Part 1: Heading
Step 1: Subheading
    • Mention the steps here
        ◦ You can also have nested steps to break a step into small tasks
Step 2: Subheading
    • Mention the steps here.
        ◦ You can also have nested steps to break a step into small tasks
For details now how everything has been implemented, refer the source code
Part 2: Heading
    • Mention the steps here
## Running the App
Steps and commands for running the app are to be included here
    • Example steps:
        Example command
## Deployment
This section is completely optional. Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
## Contributing
Mention what you expect from the people who want to contribute
We'd love to have your helping hand on Project Title! See CONTRIBUTING.md for more information on what we're looking for and how to get started.
## Versioning
If your project has multiple versions, include information about it here.
For the available versions, see the tags on this repository

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.
npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about deployment for more information.
npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

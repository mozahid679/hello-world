### `composer update`

This will fetch the latest matching versions (according to your composer. json file).\
Update the lock file with the new versions.

### `key:generate`

The `key:generate` command is used to generate a random key.\
This command will update the key stored in the application's environment file.

The command also supports an optional --show flag.\
Specifying this flag will simply show the generated key instead of updating any configuration or environment files.

### `php artisan migrate `

`php artisan migrate` publishes all our schema to the database.\
This command also creates the table in the database.

`php artisan migrate:status` checks the status of the migration.\
`migrate:status` checks the migrations we have run.

### `php artisan serve `

The Laravel PHP artisan serve command helps running applications on the PHP development server.\
This utility is extensively used for setting up migrations, routes listings, queueing, class creations, and other related tasks.

See the section about [deployment](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) for more information.
